# Data Visulization
short project to show the population density and population map

In this project I will use a dataset from "World Population Prospect 2022" located [United Nation](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/). 

There are two works here. 

1. Population density map in Canada using excel
    Analyze the locations people intend to live in Canada The data visualization shows the sparsest and densest area 
    across the country. 

    The basic tools used here
    1. Pivot Tables and conditional formatting in Excel
    2.  Power Map, a 3D visualization tool for geographic data
 
2. Population dashboard using excel
    A population dashboard is built using excel. I have leveraged the following modules in building population 
    dashboard which analyzes age structure across the countries. 
    1. Data Cleaning
    2. Pivot Table
    3. Pivot Chart
    4. Vlookup
    5. Conditional Formatting 

The reason for using excel to do these stuffs is simply for fun.
