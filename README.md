# Data Visulization using Excel
Short project to show a list of video games with sales

In this project I will use a dataset from Kaggle located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales). 

There are two works here. 

1. Sales pivot table

    Analyze the sales in a variety of platform where the video game was released. The pivot table shows sales in regions including North America, Europe, Japan and the rest of the world.  

    The basic tools used here are Pivot Tables and conditional formatting in Excel
 
2. Sales dashboard using excel
    A sales dashboard is built using excel. I have leveraged the following modules in building sales 
    visualization which analyzes the popularity of the video games across the regions. 
    1. Data Cleaning
    2. Pivot Table
    3. Pivot Chart
    4. Vlookup
    5. Conditional Formatting 

The reason for using excel to do these stuffs is simply for fun.
